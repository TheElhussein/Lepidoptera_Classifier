# Lepidoptera Classifier

Welcome to the Lepidoptera Classifier project! This repository contains code for a deep learning model that classifies between 100 species of moths and butterflies from images.

## Overview

- **Objective**: The main goal of this project is to create a classifier capable of distinguishing between various species within the Lepidoptera order.

## Pretrained Model:
- I used the ResNet50 architecture with pretrained weights from 'imagenet'. I had to modify the output layer to the number of classes I have, the 100 species of butterflies & moths. 

## Usage

You can clone the repo if you wish using ```git clone https://github.com/playboikairoo/Lepidoptera_Classifier.git```
